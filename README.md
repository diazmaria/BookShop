## C++ Bookshop

### Description
Through this C++ Bookshop prototype, users can consult a catalogue of books, e-books and cds, add them to their shopping carts and purchase them.
User's details and one or more of their credit cards details will be sroted.
When an user do a checkout a new order is created and the stock is updated.
Also, it is possible to view a list with all the orders placed
to date, sorted and grouped by product name or date of purchase, including the sum of total sales.

****Note:****
All the data would be lost when the program finishes, because no database was required for this prototype.

All the requisites where specified on an assignment for the “Programación Orientada a Objetos” (Object-oriented programming) module that I took at university (2012-2013).
